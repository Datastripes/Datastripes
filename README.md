# Datastripes

Datastripes is live and the waiting list is open — and we’d love your feedback!

Imagine a data analysis tool that runs 100% in-browser, no backend, no setup. Just open your browser and start exploring, visualizing, and narrating insights instantly.

Straight to the point: why we built it

We saw the same problem again and again: building dashboards takes weeks, even for basic datasets, requiring a rocket science degree!

We thought: leave the user free to do what matters, that is reading, understanding and acting on his/her data!

That inspired us to create a tool where analysis is intuitive, flexible, visual and AI-powered from the ground up. We want to see data fluidly flowing while transformed, to better understand how to extract information!

We powered-packed a lot of features

👉 Drag‑and‑drop canvas with 300+ modular nodes: charts, analytics, ML blocks

👉 One-click transformations and real-time data wrangling—no custom queries needed

👉 Let's data talk: transform data into podcasts and slides, because information must be consumed, not only extracted

👉 AI-powered analysis embedded locally (LLM-first): ask the data anything and get answers instantly

## How we set apart

Runs completely in-browser (no backend needed)

Multidimensional, offline-capable analysis powered by embedded local AI models

Narrated dashboards: auto-generated “podcasts” and annotated slide decks

React SDK (via NPM): embed Datastripes directly into your app as a live “data brain” that can connect to ERP or custom sources

Interactive exploration & insight without compromising workflow — flexible like tools built around collaboration
